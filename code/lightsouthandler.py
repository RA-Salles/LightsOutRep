what is this
    this is a problem generator to be used with main to solve lights out's problems and stuff
what it does (asof 07112023)
    NOTHING! But uglier (asof091123)
what it should do
    create domain file, write it down
    create problem based on args OR a file. preferably a file
    call solver and wait for a solution
    parse solution
