problemcreator.py
    gets args to create the problem. Save the file somewhere.
    
solver.py
    gets a problem and a domain. Passes it to the solver (fast downward, madagascar, etc.) and generates an output file

solutionparser.py
    gets a solver output and parses it so it is pretty as required

main.py
    incapsulates everything, gives calls, scripts everything in a package. Ultrafun!

what we need:
    THE DOMAIN IS MISSING! Ain't my job, but i gotta see with the man so i can get it.
        gotta decide to either hardcode it or not. we'll see. 
    
    ALL THE FILES ARE MISSING
        gotta sit on my ass and code it. Very Fun!
    
    VIOLENCE!
        There's a violent rat somewhere in my house. I will blow him with dynamite. 
        wish me luck. I will need it. :>
